Hi! I’m a third-year Computer Science undergrad @ Cornell University. I work in the [EmPRISE Lab](https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/) under [Prof. Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee](https://sites.google.com/site/tapomayukh), where my research focuses on human-robot interaction and leveraging robots to assist humans with daily living activities in home environments. 

Previously, I worked on reinforcement learning for in-hand manipulation of bioinspired robots through the Science Internship Program at UC Santa Cruz, under the mentorship of [Dr. Michael Wehner](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael-Wehner-2). I also interned at Stanford University’s [Robinson Lab](https://robinsonlab.stanford.edu/), where I studied gene expression in equine RNA-seq data to better understand cartilage degradation.
